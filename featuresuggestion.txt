### Intended features:

1.

- Styling page:

  - Organization and Commenting:
    Group related styles and comments to make the code more organized and understandable.
    Use comments to describe the purpose of different sections in my code.

  - Use Variables: Define variables for commonly used colours, fonts, and other properties to make changes
    easier and ensure consistency.

  - Use Classes for Reusable Elements:
    Define classes for reusable elements like buttons and links to ensure consistency and make global changes
    easier.

  - Avoid Duplicate Styles: I have some duplicate styles for .menu-button-container. I maintain consistency
    in my classes to avoid redundancy.

  - Improve Responsiveness: Ensure the layout and design are responsive for various screen sizes. Test and
    adjust the styles to make the website look good on small and large screens.

2.

- The future, which I like to add:

  - User Profiles and Ride History:
    Implement user profiles and ride history to enhance the user experience and provide valuable information to my app users. With this feature, users can:
  - Ride History: Users can view a detailed history of their scooter rides, including date and time. Privacy and Security Settings: Users can manage their privacy settings, including who can see their ride history and personal information.

- The feature ChatsGPT gives me is the same as students about adding dynamic elements ChatGPT suggests, like adding a profile and history to the user to improve the user experience.

- The features I will complete in the 25th Oct class are to improve my Styling page as mentioned in the intended feature.
