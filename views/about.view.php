            <p>
            We aim to transform the transportation and exploration experience for individuals in Comox Valley. Go Scoot is excited to offer a reliable, eco-friendly electric scooter, ensuring your travels are both convenient and delightful.            </p>
            <p>
            Our fascination with e-scooters took root during the pandemic shutdown, a time of boredom and restlessness. The moment we hopped onto these robust two-wheeled wonders, we were instantly captivated! The city of Courtenay unfolds as a breathtaking backdrop, offering a picturesque and easily navigable terrain for swift exploration.            </p>
            <p>
            Out of this delightful meeting, the inception of RunRentals took place. In the spring of 2022, our storefront debuted in Comox Valley, situated at the core of downtown Courtenay.            </p>
