# Project Plan
## The features and fixes:
### Priority:
    - Fix the colour scheme to make things more visible.
    - Make the booking more approachable on the ride page.
    - Make the booking system work correctly.
    - Add the function to check the minimum password length.
    - Add pop-ups or alerts to display the form feedback    - Additional after completing priority:
    - Add improvements to the booking page.
    - Add the change password feature in the login form.

### Techniques I’ll use:
    - My existing stylesheet knowledge will help me to fix the colour scheme and ride page format.
    - The Laracast video 25-26 will help me to fix the booking system to work correctly as expected.
    - The ch5 and ch8 from the book will help me to create the function for the password length specification.
    - I will create the popup function using JavaScript to display form feedback.
    - Improvements in the booking page I will explore some improvements or ideas from the book and try to add a feature to make any improvements.
    - One of the coming weeks’ videos will help change the password. Otherwise, I will try to find the solution by adding another form, the most minor priority step. 

### Schedule:
    - Research about the priority features and fixes was done in the previous week.
    - This week, I will fix the colour contrast issues and make the content more apparent and visible.
    - This week (15 Nov – 22 Nov), I will try to find the error in my booking system that is causing the problem; otherwise, I will fix it by using the 25-26 Laracast video.
    - If something is left this week (22 Nov – 29 Nov), I will complete that next week and then implement the function for the password word limit.
    - In the next week (22 Nov – 29 Nov), I will try to find the best way to implement a JavaScript popup or alert function to display form feedback and implement it.
    - If I have time before the deadline, then I will try to implement the least priority features.
