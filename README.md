## PHP Project

### Milestone 1:
- I completed the first stage of the project, which involved developing the user interface (UI) by producing low-fidelity wireframes, in Milestone 1. These wireframes provide as a basic illustration of the project's appearance and functionality.

- Simple digital mockups that depict the user interface's overall flow, content arrangement, and structural structure are called low-fidelity wireframes. In order to concentrate entirely on the essential structure and functioning, they are purposefully kept basic and devoid of complex design feature and describe the way it works.

### Milestone 2:

- I've successfully developed the front end of the project, building upon the initial design concept outlined in Milestone 1 with several key enhancements. The user interface now offers a more refined and user-friendly design, incorporating improved visual elements to enhance the overall user experience. While the database connection is pending, I've completed the signup and login forms, ensuring a secure and seamless registration process. So, after database setup, users can sign up through the form to access electric scooters. The database still needs to be fully integrated. In milestone 3, it will process and securely collect user information. Users will log in and access electric scooter booking, with improved efficiency in fetching data from the database. This milestone is an important step forward in the project's journey toward its milestone 3, the high-quality state with a database connection.
