## PHP Project

### Milestone 1:
- I completed the first stage of the project, which involved developing the user interface (UI) by producing low-fidelity wireframes, in Milestone 1. These wireframes provide as a basic illustration of the project's appearance and functionality.

- Simple digital mockups that depict the user interface's overall flow, content arrangement, and structural structure are called low-fidelity wireframes. In order to concentrate entirely on the essential structure and functioning, they are purposefully kept basic and devoid of complex design feature and describe the way it works.
