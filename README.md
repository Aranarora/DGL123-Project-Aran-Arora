# DGL123-Project-Aran-Arora

## PHP Project

### Milestone 1:
- I completed the first stage of the project, which involved developing the user interface (UI) by producing low-fidelity wireframes, in Milestone 1. These wireframes provide as a basic illustration of the project's appearance and functionality.

- Simple digital mockups that depict the user interface's overall flow, content arrangement, and structural structure are called low-fidelity wireframes. In order to concentrate entirely on the essential structure and functioning, they are purposefully kept basic and devoid of complex design feature and describe the way it works.

### Milestone 2:

- I've successfully developed the front end of the project, building upon the initial design concept outlined in Milestone 1 with several key enhancements. The user interface now offers a more refined and user-friendly design, incorporating improved visual elements to enhance the overall user experience. While the database connection is pending, I've completed the signup and login forms, ensuring a secure and seamless registration process. So, after database setup, users can sign up through the form to access electric scooters. The database still needs to be fully integrated. In milestone 3, it will process and securely collect user information. Users will log in and access electric scooter booking, with improved efficiency in fetching data from the database. This milestone is an important step forward in the project's journey toward its milestone 3, the high-quality state with a database connection.


### Milestone 3:

- In Milestone 3, a significant milestone has been reached in the project's development. The signup and login forms have been successfully connected, enhancing the user experience and security. Notably, we've implemented specific functions and conditions to ensure data integrity and user-friendly interactions.

User ID Restrictions: Users can now only enter a user ID that contains a combination of alphabets and numbers, improving data quality and security.

Unique Email and User ID: The system prevents the registration of accounts with duplicate email addresses or user IDs. This ensures the uniqueness of user credentials and enhances data integrity.

Password Validation: Password and password repeat fields have been implemented with validation checks. Users are prompted to enter their password twice to ensure accuracy, and the system verifies that the two entries match.

These additions not only enhance the security of user data but also contribute to a smoother and more reliable user experience. Milestone 3 represents a significant leap forward in the project's development, ensuring that user interactions are more secure and user-friendly while laying the groundwork for future database integration.
